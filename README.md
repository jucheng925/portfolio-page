ideas - to showcase puzzles (similar to linkedin theme)
-- either animation (falling puzzles into their places) or engage audience by having them move the pieces before opening the site.

puzzles - using box and circle to make a jigsaw puzzles (probably only for animation falling in place)


Either a puzzle theme, world theme, painting theme?
